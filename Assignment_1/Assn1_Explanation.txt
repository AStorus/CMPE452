Each line on the diagram provided by the instructor for the assignment is represented by a neuron

If the point lies within the bounds of the line, that neuron then fires
For example, neuron A represents the line y = 4, so if any point has a lower y value than 4, that neuron fires (ie 3 would fire, 5 would not)
Those neurons in the first layer then feed into the second Hidden Layer
I treat this problem as if it were 2 shapes, so the left side and right side neurons detect if the point is within those 2 'shapes'

the leftside and rightside neurons are then fed into the output neuron, which determines whether or not the point is within those 
two shapes through use of a logical OR gate
